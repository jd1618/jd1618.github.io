**Credit Risk Consultant, True North Partners LLP** | **PhD in Mathematical Physics, Imperial College London** | **CQF Alumnus (Distinction)** | **MSc in Applied Mathematics, Imperial College London (Distinction)** | **BSc in Mathematics, University of Nottingham (First Class Honours)**

My background includes notable research contributions in fluid dynamics and mathematical physics, with several publications in prestigious academic journals and special issues. Passionate about the synergy of mathematics, programming, and finance, I employ analytical methodologies and concepts in data science and machine learning to develop models and address challenges related to credit risk.


## Professional Experience

### Credit Risk Consultant, TNP, September 2023-Present:

IFRS 9 Model Development:
• _Validating SARIMAX and regression models, reproducing coefficients, p-values and statistical test results_
• _Developing macroeconomic models and evaluating stability using k-fold, dominance and sensitivity analysis_
• _Exploring account data to assess/re-calibrate PD models and signature curve methodology to derive risk grades_
• _Producing modular and documented Python code for data analysis, making use of OOP principles, data structures and unit tests_
• _B/S management, involving the forecast of: assets, liabilities, equity, P&L, NPAs, RWAs, provisions and capital ratios_
• _ICAAP development, accounting for idiosyncratic, market and combined stress scenarios with reverse stress testing_
• _Working with credit rating transition matrices and deriving exponential relationships for rates of default_
• _Writing documentation that details the mathematics and methodology employed during the project life cycle_
* _Carrying out research for asset and liability product offerings in the banking industry, including gap analysis_

### Postdoctoral Researcher, Imperial College London, July-August 2023:

Contributions:
* _Published in the special issue 'Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena in Fluid Dynamics' in the Elsevier journal_
* _Published in the special issue 'Coherent Vortices' in the journal of Physics of Fluids_

Reasearch Summary:
* _Characterised the instability of quasi-geostrophic eastward dipole steady states by a critical Davies mode using high-resolution numerical simulations_
* _Verified the linear instability of eastward dipoles by obtaining solutions to the complete eigenproblem_
* _Investigated the influence of tilting on the dipole instability, including scenarios of steady state adjustment_
* _Formulated the nonlinear destruction mechanism and associated energetics of eastward dipoles_
* _Briefly explored the dynamics of dipole-rider vortices and how they compared with the unstable dipole counterpart_

### Actuary Intern, First Actuarial, June-July 2022:

Pensions:
* _Was introduced to defined contribution and defined benefit schemes_
* _Gained proficiency in Excel: cleaning, manipulating, and visualising data_
* _Performed transfer value calculations, incorporating: late retirement factors, annuity adjustment and GMP equalization_
* _Engaged with: client verification, factor review, actuarial reporting and sensitivity analysis_

Investments:
* _Obtained knowledge of bonds, commodities, derivatives, equities, swaps and how they behave in different economic scenarios_
* _Presented a talk on "Investment Insight for Pension Schemes" to founders and partners of the firm_
