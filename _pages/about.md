**Credit Risk Consultant, True North Partners LLP** | **PhD in Mathematical Physics, Imperial College London** | **CQF Alumnus (Distinction)** | **MSc in Applied Mathematics, Imperial College London (Distinction)** | **BSc in Mathematics, University of Nottingham (First Class Honours)**

My background includes notable research contributions in fluid dynamics and mathematical physics, with several publications in prestigious academic journals and special issues. Passionate about the synergy of mathematics, programming, and finance, I employ analytical methodologies and concepts in data science and machine learning to develop models and address challenges related to credit risk.


## Professional Experience

Project experience:
* _Validating credit risk models, including IFRS 9, market risk and pricing models_
* _Collecting and presenting market research, assessing competition and product offerings in the banking industry_
* _Validating macroeconomic SARIMAX and regression models by assessing stability and other statistical properties_
* _Exploring account data to assess/re-calibrate signature curve methodology to derive risk grades_
* _Producing modular Python code for data analysis, making use of OOP principles, data structures and unit tests_
* _Writing documentation that details the mathematics and methodology employed during the project life cycle_
* _Balance sheet management, forecasting and ICAAP development_

### Postdoctoral Researcher, Imperial College London, July-August 2023:

Contributions:
* _Published in the special issue 'Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena in Fluid Dynamics' in the journal 'Elsevier'_
* _Published in the special issue 'Coherent Vortices' in the journal of 'Physics of Fluids'_

Reasearch Summary:
* _Characterised the instability of quasi-geostrophic eastward dipole steady states by a critical Davies mode using high-resolution numerical simulations_
* _Verified the linear instability of eastward dipoles by obtaining solutions to the complete eigenproblem_
* _Investigated the influence of tilting on the dipole instability, including scenarios of steady state adjustment_
* _Formulated the nonlinear destruction mechanism and associated energetics of eastward dipoles_
* _Briefly explored the dynamics of dipole-rider vortices and how they compared with the unstable dipole counterpart_

### Actuary Intern, First Actuarial, June-July 2022:

Pensions:
